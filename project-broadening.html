				<p class="description"style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><i>Broadening the Museum</i> proposes to the Fitzwilliam Museum a new learning space bringing ideas from the sciences and current affairs into the museum. The project begins with the understanding that the idea of the museum’s permanent collection can no longer fully engage and take a stand on the most pertinent social agenda of the day. As a corrective to this system, the project utilises Cambridge’s exceptional community of experts, institutions, and activists in the sciences and current affairs to constantly provide outside perspectives that can form and transform the museum’s institutional perspective. It proposes an annual residency programme in which invited organisations will become curators in exhibitions, workshops, and lectures on their field of expertise. The currently underused reference library of the museum is extended to connect to Grove Lodge, another underused building in the museum site. The proposal uses the timber roof trusses as the element unifying the two and continues them seamlessly into the new space. Visitors will enter through the front yard and find an exhibition space curated by the resident institution. Afterwards, they may continue to the domestic-scale cafe lounge, visit the archive library to delve further into the resident institutions’ research, past and present, or attend events in the lecture hall, the smaller meeting space, and workshop space.</p>
