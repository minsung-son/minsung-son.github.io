				The proposal is Fitzwilliam Museum Chesterton, a satellite museum in the neighbourhood of Chesterton that brings art closer to the local public life through an intensely public experience of interacting with art. Chesterton is a neighbourhood northeast of Cambridge city centre. It is largely residential, and home to many local shops, restaurants, and businesses representative of the ‘town’ side of Cambridge’s town-and-gown divide. 

				<br><br>Contrary to city centre, where the Fitzwilliam is currently located, Chesterton is geographically and sentimentally much less associated with the University. If the current museum, through its neoclassical architecture and established modes of display, assumes a grand attitude as the University’s centre of cultural preservation and exhibition, a decidedly different approach is required as it redistributes itself to Chesterton. The new satellite museum needs to engage with the public life taking place around it, in order to make art accessible to this residential neighbourhood.

				<br><br>The Victoria Road Island, the site for the redistribution, presents clear opportunities for this mission. Located in the centre of Chesterton in which the high street meets more residential blocks, the entire traffic island is occupied by one building combining many building fragments of different styles and constructions. Most of the building is now derelict, and calls for the injection of programmes to bring it back to life.

				<br><br>The island’s sheer size of and the lack of programme divides adjacent blocks, and limits walkability around the area. The site calls for a casual museum that is as integrated as possible with the local public life, one that can be visited once a week, as opposed to once a year, while walking a dog, for example.

				<br><br>Ideas of paths and permeability offer a strategy to deal with this urban-minded brief. Creating paths through big, previously monolithic areas can connect can connect surrounding areas by improving urban permeability. Historic maps of the Victoria Road Island, featuring paths currently missing in the site, offer the potential for this to happen in Chesterton while also revealing what was there in the past. First, the existing structure and partitions are marked, on which the morphology of the historic paths are overlayed. This guides the generation of new forms, paths, and places informed by both the site’s past and its present.

				<br><br>The result is that what was once very monolithic and closed, both the site building itself and museum architecture as a typology, is exploded to form an intensely open and smaller-scale network of spaces. The opened up ground floor hosts open storage spaces for ceramics, sensitive objects, and sculpture, divided by object type for optimal temperature and humidity control. The objects here will change frequently depending on the museum’s storage and exhibition needs, both in Chesterton and in its original location. It also hosts a visible art unloading and handling area, two project spaces for short-term events, a workshop space, a cafe, a bookshop and a museum store. Most of the site is now completely open public pathway, and can be accessed by pedestrians through five entrances as they go grocery shopping or dog walking. Once they find an artwork that interests them, they can stop and flow through the galleries freely. They might, for example, discover the derelict building has been opened up as they walk down for lunch on the high street, enter through the ramp, interact with the open storage facilities, and continue to the restaurant using one of the other entrances.

				<br><br>Strategically placed sightlines are an important part of the design: one may discover an interesting artwork as they have a coffee at the cafe, on the way to another artwork, or simply moving through the island. These sightlines play a key role in intriguing the pedestrians and encouraging them to interact with the artworks.

				<br><br>To complete the proposal, an additional two-part strategy that have been used is the adding and subtracting of volumes. This entails of the partial removal of the existing roof slab, and the addition of a first floor gallery space on the other half of the existing building. In the proposal, the roof slab is partially carved away to recreate the public atmosphere of neighbourhood alleyways and to bring daylight into these paths. This creates a sequence of unroofed and roofed public spaces as one moves through the ground floor.

				<br><br>If the ground floor displays artworks more casually and in a less curated way through open storage spaces and short-term project spaces, the new first floor gallery accommodates more curated, organised, or ticketed exhibitions. Intrigued by the displays downstairs, the visitor is naturally led up to these exhibitions through the prominent central staircase. Together, the carved away roof slab and the added first floor volume generates an interesting mix of spaces, diversified in height, programme, and atmosphere.

				<br><br>In the long term, the proposal argues for the pedestrian experience around the museum to be improved through the pedestrianisation of Chesterton Road. The current approach to the museum island, going through a one-way, three-lane roundabout using multiple crossings and traffic islands, is rather inconvenient. With this in mind, the long-term planning proposal adopts traffic rearrangement proposals already made by the Cambridge City Council. The new pedestrianised area will become a new outdoor space for bigger pieces of public art, and community activities that connect the museum to the restaurants and pubs across the street.</p>
